**MY_RADAR** – Air Traffic Control Simulation
*Description:*

*MY_RADAR* is an Epitech project consisting of developing a 2D air traffic control panel, in C language, using the CSFML library.

The program simulates the movement of planes between different points, the management of collisions, as well as air traffic control zones represented by control towers.

The entities are loaded from a script passed as an argument, and the simulation is displayed in real time in a graphics window.

*Project objectives:*

    · Simulate air traffic in 2D
    · Manage planes and control towers
    · Detect and handle collisions
    · Allow certain collisions in control zones
    · User interactions

*Airplanes :*

    · Move in a straight line at constant speed
    · Appear after a takeoff delay
    · Disappear upon landing or after a collision
    · 20x20 pixel square hitbox
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
*Control towers :*

    · Fixes towers
    · Have a circular control zone
    · Allow planes to pass each other without collision
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
**Simulation script**

The program takes a single argument: the path to a script file describing the entities.

*Format*
Airplane

    · A x_start y_start x_end y_end speed delay
